### What is it


### Wanna join us?

Wanna play? 

Just send your pull request with your solution. Remember to name your file as follows:

pXX/pXX_YYY.ZZZ

Where:

* pXX/ is a directory/folder with the exercise number.
* XX is the exercise number, from 01 to 99 always with two digits
* YY is your Github username, in lowercase
* ZZZ is the standard file extension for the language: `cl`, `clj`, `scm`, `rkt`, `lisp`, `el`, `arc`...

*Both directory and filenames must be in lowercase*

*Pull requests that don't merge smoothly and don't respect these rules won't be accepted*

### Extra challenge

How hard and funny was using McCarthy's LISP on 60's? 

To revive this days I'll try to complete the L99 using only the 7 
primitive operators (quote, atom, eq, car, cdr, cons and cond) and if necessary (and it'll be), macros.
